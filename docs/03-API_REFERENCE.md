# API Reference Guide

This document provides a detailed reference for all available API endpoints.

**Base URL**: `/api/v1`

## üîê Authentication

### Database-Managed Users (V4 Schema)
The authentication system uses database-managed users with BCrypt password hashing, replacing the previous hardcoded system.

### User Bootstrap Process:
The application requires initial user setup through a bootstrap service (implemented in task-14). No default users are seeded in migrations following enterprise security best practices.

### Available Roles:
- **ADMIN**: Full CRUD operations, user management, role management, API key management, MCP access
- **MANAGER**: Write operations, delete operations, API key management, MCP access (no user management)
- **USER**: Read operations, MCP tools and resources, SSE access
- **READONLY**: Minimal read-only access, limited MCP resources
