# Progress: Current State of the Project

## What Works
- **Project Planning**: All initial tasks have been defined in the `backlog/` directory.
- **API Design**: The API contract and data models are documented.
- **Database Environment**: The PostgreSQL database runs in Docker.
- **JPA Entity**: The `Product` entity is defined and the project builds successfully with Testcontainers for the test scope.

## What's Left to Build
The rest of the application layers need to be implemented:
1.  Database schema creation (Flyway).
2.  Repository, Service, and Controller layers.
3.  Comprehensive testing.
4.  Final documentation and deployment preparation.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Development.
- **Next Task**: `task-7 - Create-Initial-DB-Schema-with-Flyway.md`.

## Known Issues
- No known issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The project will use Testcontainers with PostgreSQL for integration tests instead of an in-memory database like H2 to ensure the test environment closely mirrors production.
