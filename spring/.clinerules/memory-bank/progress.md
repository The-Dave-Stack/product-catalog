# Progress: Current State of the Project

## What Works
- **Project Planning**: All initial tasks have been defined in the `backlog/` directory, outlining the entire project lifecycle from setup to deployment.
- **API Design**: The API contract, data models, and key technical decisions have been documented in `backlog/docs/doc-1 - API-Design-Product-Catalog.md`.

## What's Left to Build
The entire application needs to be implemented. The project is currently in the pre-development phase. Key upcoming stages include:
1.  Initial project scaffolding.
2.  Git repository setup.
3.  Database and Docker environment setup.
4.  Implementation of all application layers (Entity, Repository, Service, Controller).
5.  Comprehensive testing.
6.  Final documentation and deployment preparation.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Pre-development.
- **Next Task**: `task-2 - Set-Up-Initial-Spring-Boot-Project-using-MCP-Tool.md`, which is currently blocked by `task-5 - Set-Up-PostgreSQL-with-Docker-Compose.md`.

## Known Issues
- The initial project build is blocked pending the creation of the Dockerized PostgreSQL database.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- No decisions have evolved yet. The project is still following the initial plan.
