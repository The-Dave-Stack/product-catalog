# Progress: Current State of the Project

## What Works
- **Project Planning**: All initial tasks have been defined in the `backlog/` directory.
- **API Design**: The API contract and data models are documented.
- **Database Environment**: The PostgreSQL database runs in Docker.
- **JPA Entity**: The `Product` entity is defined.
- **Database Schema**: The initial database schema is created and managed by Flyway.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A full suite of unit, repository, and integration tests are in place.
- **E2E Testing**: Fully integrated E2E tests using Testcontainers and RestAssured with 6 comprehensive test scenarios.
- **Complete API Implementation**: All CRUD operations are implemented and tested.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes.
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and business rule enforcement.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose setup for deployment.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI is integrated and documenting the API.

## What's Left to Build
1. **Final Documentation**: Update README.md with current project state and setup instructions.
2. **Deployment Preparation**: Ensure all documentation is complete for production deployment.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Near completion - only documentation updates remaining.
- **Next Task**: `task-13 - Update Final Project Documentation (README.md)`.

## Known Issues
- None currently. All E2E tests pass successfully.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **E2E Testing Strategy**: Initially planned as separate module, but successfully integrated into main project structure for better maintainability.
- **Testcontainers Approach**: Evolved from using full Docker Compose stack to using only PostgreSQL Testcontainer for better test isolation and performance.
- **Testing Framework**: Added RestAssured for comprehensive API testing capabilities.
- **Logging Strategy**: Implemented debug logging in tests for better traceability and troubleshooting.
