# Progress: Current State of the Project

## What Works
- **Project Planning**: All initial tasks have been defined in the `backlog/` directory.
- **API Design**: The API contract and data models are documented.
- **Database Environment**: The PostgreSQL database runs in Docker.
- **JPA Entity**: The `Product` entity is defined.
- **Database Schema**: The initial database schema is created and managed by Flyway.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A full suite of unit, repository, and integration tests are in place.
- **E2E Test Module**: A new Maven module `e2e-tests` has been created with initial test classes and dependencies.

## What's Left to Build
The rest of the application layers need to be implemented:
1.  Final documentation and deployment preparation.
2.  **E2E Test Fixes**: The E2E tests need to be fixed to successfully start the Docker Compose containers.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Development.
- **Next Task**: `task-14 - Create Java-based E2E Tests using Testcontainers` (requires troubleshooting).

## Known Issues
- Testcontainers `ContainerLaunchException` preventing E2E tests from running.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The project will use Testcontainers with PostgreSQL for integration tests instead of an in-memory database like H2 to ensure the test environment closely mirrors production.
- The E2E tests are now in a separate Maven module for better separation of concerns.
