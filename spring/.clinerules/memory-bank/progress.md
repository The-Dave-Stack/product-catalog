# Progress: Current State of the Project

## What Works
- **Project Planning**: All initial tasks have been defined in the `backlog/` directory, outlining the entire project lifecycle from setup to deployment.
- **API Design**: The API contract, data models, and key technical decisions have been documented in `backlog/docs/doc-1 - API-Design-Product-Catalog.md`.

## What's Left to Build
The entire application needs to be implemented. The project is currently in the pre-development phase. Key upcoming stages include:
1.  Initial project scaffolding.
2.  Database and Docker environment setup.
4.  Implementation of all application layers (Entity, Repository, Service, Controller).
5.  Comprehensive testing.
6.  Final documentation and deployment preparation.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Pre-development.
- **Next Task**: `task-5 - Set-Up-PostgreSQL-with-Docker-Compose.md`, which is the primary blocker for `task-2`.
- **Remote Repository**: The remote GitHub repository is now configured and all branches have been pushed.

## Known Issues
- The initial project build is blocked pending the creation of the Dockerized PostgreSQL database.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- No decisions have evolved yet. The project is still following the initial plan.
