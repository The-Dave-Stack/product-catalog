# Active Context: Current Focus and Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
With the `Product` entity defined, the next priority is to create the initial database schema using Flyway.

## Recent Changes
- **Completed `task-6`**: Defined the `Product` JPA Entity.
- Added Testcontainers to the project for robust integration testing against a real PostgreSQL database.

## Next Steps
1.  **Proceed with `task-7`**: Create the initial database schema with a Flyway migration script.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project will strictly follow the Git Flow branching model. All new work will be done on feature branches off of `develop`.
- All database schema changes will be managed via Flyway migrations. No manual database changes are permitted.
- All integration tests will run against a Testcontainers-managed PostgreSQL instance to ensure consistency with the production environment.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project's success is heavily dependent on the correct setup of the Dockerized environment. A failure in the Docker setup will halt all development progress.
