# Active Context: Current Focus and Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
The project has successfully completed the E2E testing integration. The focus is now on finalizing project documentation and preparing for deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Completed `task-14` (fully)**: Successfully integrated E2E tests into the main project structure, eliminating the separate `e2e-tests` module.
- **E2E Test Integration**: Moved E2E tests from separate module to `src/test/java/com/thedavestack/productcatalog/e2e/` within the main project.
- **Testcontainers Implementation**: Configured E2E tests to use only PostgreSQL Testcontainer (not full Docker Compose stack) for better isolation and performance.
- **RestAssured Integration**: Added RestAssured dependency to main `pom.xml` for comprehensive API testing.
- **Debug Logging**: Implemented comprehensive debug logging throughout E2E tests for full traceability.
- **Test Coverage**: Created 6 comprehensive E2E test scenarios covering all CRUD operations, error handling, and business logic validation.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete `task-13`**: Update Final Project Documentation (README.md) to reflect the current state and setup instructions.
2. **Project Finalization**: Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and the project is ready for deployment.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project follows Git Flow branching model with all work done on feature branches off of `develop`.
- All database schema changes are managed via Flyway migrations with no manual database changes permitted.
- E2E tests run against Testcontainers-managed PostgreSQL instance for consistency with production environment.
- E2E tests are now integrated into the main project structure for simplified maintenance and execution.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Integrating E2E tests directly into the main project structure provides better maintainability than separate modules.
- Using only PostgreSQL Testcontainer (instead of full Docker Compose) for E2E tests provides better isolation and faster test execution.
- RestAssured provides excellent API testing capabilities with clear, readable test syntax.
- Debug logging in tests is crucial for troubleshooting and understanding test execution flow.
