# Active Context: Current Focus and Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on resolving the Testcontainers container startup issues for the newly added E2E test module.

## Recent Changes
- **Completed `task-14` (partially)**: Created a new Maven module `e2e-tests`, added necessary dependencies, and implemented `BaseE2ETest.java` and `ProductE2ETest.java`.
- **Maven Project Structure**: Converted the main `product-catalog-spring` to a multi-module project (later reverted) and then made `e2e-tests` a standalone module to resolve build issues.
- **Testcontainers Path**: Corrected the `docker-compose.yml` path in `BaseE2ETest.java` to use an absolute path.
- **Tests are currently failing**: Testcontainers is unable to start the Docker Compose services, leading to `ContainerLaunchException`.

## Next Steps
1.  **Troubleshoot Testcontainers**: Investigate and resolve the `ContainerLaunchException` preventing Docker Compose services from starting in the E2E tests. This might involve checking Docker daemon status, Testcontainers logs, or adjusting Docker Compose configuration.
2.  **Proceed with `task-13`**: Update Final Project Documentation (README.md) once E2E tests are functional.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project will strictly follow the Git Flow branching model. All new work will be done on feature branches off of `develop`.
- All database schema changes will be managed via Flyway migrations. No manual database changes are permitted.
- All integration tests will run against a Testcontainers-managed PostgreSQL instance to ensure consistency with the production environment.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project's success is heavily dependent on the correct setup of the Dockerized environment. A failure in the Docker setup will halt all development progress.
- Setting up multi-module Maven projects with Spring Boot and Testcontainers requires careful path management and understanding of Maven's project aggregation.
