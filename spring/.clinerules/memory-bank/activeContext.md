# Active Context: Current Focus and Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
The immediate priority is to establish the foundational infrastructure for the project. This involves setting up the database environment and ensuring the initial Spring Boot application can build and connect to it successfully.

## Recent Changes
- The Memory Bank has just been initialized with comprehensive context derived from the project's planning and design documents.

## Next Steps
1.  **Proceed with `task-3`**: Initialize the Git repository and create the `main` and `develop` branches.
2.  **Proceed with `task-4`**: Create the remote GitHub repository and push the initial branches.
3.  **Complete `task-5`**: Set up the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose. This is the primary blocker for all subsequent development tasks.
4.  **Unblock and Complete `task-2`**: With the database running, finalize the initial Spring Boot project setup and verify that the application can connect to the database.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project will strictly follow the Git Flow branching model. All new work will be done on feature branches off of `develop`.
- All database schema changes will be managed via Flyway migrations. No manual database changes are permitted.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project's success is heavily dependent on the correct setup of the Dockerized environment. A failure in the Docker setup will halt all development progress.
