## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Create package 'com.thedavestack.productcatalog.model'.
2. Create class 'Product.java'.
3. Use @Data, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, @Entity, @Table(name = \"products\").
4. Define fields: id (String), sku (String), name (String), description (String), price (BigDecimal), category (String), createdAt (Instant), updatedAt (Instant).
5. Annotate 'id' with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID).
6. Add @Column constraints to sku, name, and price.
7. Use @CreationTimestamp and @UpdateTimestamp for automatic date management.
