## Description

Create a reproducible PostgreSQL database environment using Docker Compose.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 'docker-compose.yml' exists and defines the 'postgres-db' service.
- [ ] 'application.properties' has correct datasource properties.
- [ ] 'docker-compose up -d' starts the container successfully.
- [ ] The Spring Boot application connects to the database.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. In the project's root directory, create 'docker-compose.yml'.
2. Define a service 'postgres-db' using the image 'postgres:17.5-alpine'.
3. Map port 5432:5432 and configure environment variables (POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD).
4. Define a named volume for data persistence.
5. In 'application.properties', add the datasource properties to connect to the Docker container.
