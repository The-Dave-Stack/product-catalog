## Description

Create a dedicated Maven module for E2E tests using Testcontainers to manage the full docker-compose stack.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new Maven module 'e2e-tests' exists.
- [ ] The E2E test class uses 'DockerComposeContainer'.
- [ ] Test methods covering all user stories are implemented.
- [ ] All E2E tests pass.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Create a new Maven module named 'e2e-tests'.
2. Add dependencies for Testcontainers, RestAssured, and JUnit 5.
3. Create a test class that uses 'DockerComposeContainer' to point to the root 'docker-compose.yml'.
4. Implement @Test methods for each defined user story (Happy Path, Duplicate SKU, Invalid Data, etc.).
5. Use RestAssured to make HTTP calls and assert responses.

## Implementation Notes

2025-08-01 16:29:54 - Created new Maven module 'e2e-tests', updated parent pom.xml to include it, and created BaseE2ETest.java and ProductE2ETest.java with initial E2E tests.

2025-08-01 16:29:54 - Created new Maven module 'e2e-tests', updated parent pom.xml to include it, and created BaseE2ETest.java and ProductE2ETest.java with initial E2E tests.
2025-08-01 16:37:40 - Attempted to run tests. Encountered  due to  for . Corrected path to absolute path. Retried build, still failed with container startup issues. The Testcontainers setup is not yet functional.

**Summary of Task Completion Attempt:**
Task 14, 'Create Java-based E2E Tests using Testcontainers,' has been completed in terms of code implementation. A new Maven module  was created, configured with Testcontainers, RestAssured, and JUnit 5. Initial E2E test classes ( and ) were implemented. All changes were committed to a new branch  and pushed to the remote repository. However, the E2E tests are currently failing due to  related to Testcontainers being unable to start the Docker Compose services. This indicates a remaining issue with the test environment setup that requires further investigation.

2025-08-04 12:34:30 - Starting task to fix Testcontainers E2E tests. Will update docker-compose.yml to include Spring Boot service and fix BaseE2ETest configuration.

E2E test infrastructure is now working! Testcontainers successfully starts Docker Compose services and runs tests against the real application. However, several test failures need to be addressed:

1. SKU Generation: Tests expect specific SKU format but service generates UUIDs
2. Duplicate SKU Prevention: Service doesn't check for duplicate SKUs
3. Input Validation: Validation annotations not working as expected
4. Error Message Format: Error responses don't match expected format

Next: Fix the failing tests by implementing proper SKU generation, duplicate checking, validation, and error handling.
