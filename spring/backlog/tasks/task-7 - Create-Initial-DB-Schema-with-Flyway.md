## Description

Create the first Flyway migration script for the 'products' table.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A SQL migration file exists in 'src/main/resources/db/migration'.
- [x] The SQL script contains the correct 'CREATE TABLE' statement.
- [x] Flyway successfully applies the migration on application startup.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. In 'src/main/resources/db/migration', create a new SQL file named 'V1__Create_products_table.sql'.
2. Write the 'CREATE TABLE products (...)' SQL statement in this file.
3. The table schema must match the fields defined in the 'Product' entity, including types and constraints.
