## Description

Create a multi-stage Dockerfile with a HEALTHCHECK and verification process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] 'Dockerfile' with multi-stage build and HEALTHCHECK exists.
- [x] 'docker build' completes successfully.
- [x] The verification process (run, check, health, stop) completes successfully.
- [x] Human review and approval.
## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Create a 'Dockerfile' in the project root.
2. Implement a multi-stage build (build stage with Maven, runtime stage with JRE).
3. Add a 'HEALTHCHECK' instruction pointing to '/actuator/health'.
4. In 'application.properties', ensure the health endpoint is exposed.
5. Verify the image by running it with '--rm', checking its health, and stopping it.

## Implementation Notes

[2025-08-01 15:36:49] - Created Dockerfile, built image, and successfully verified container.

Created a multi-stage Dockerfile using bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:21 as the base image. Added a HEALTHCHECK instruction to verify the application's health. Successfully built the Docker image and verified that the container runs and the application is accessible.

[2025-08-01 15:40:46] - Task completed. The application is now fully containerized and ready for the final documentation phase.
