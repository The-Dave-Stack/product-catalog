## Description

Expose business logic via RESTful endpoints, using DTOs and a global exception handler.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 'ProductController.java' and DTOs exist.
- [ ] All MVP endpoints are implemented.
- [ ] A @ControllerAdvice exception handler is implemented.
- [ ] API uses DTOs exclusively.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Create 'com.thedavestack.productcatalog.dto' package and define DTOs ('ProductResponse', 'CreateProductRequest') with validation annotations.
2. Create 'com.thedavestack.productcatalog.controller' package and class 'ProductController.java'.
3. Annotate with @RestController and @RequestMapping(\"/api/v1/products\").
4. Implement methods for all MVP endpoints, using DTOs for request and response bodies.
5. Implement a mapper component to convert between entities and DTOs.
6. Create a @ControllerAdvice class to handle custom exceptions and return appropriate HTTP errors.
