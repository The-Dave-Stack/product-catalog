## Description

Use the springinitializr-mcp tool to generate the base project structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The project has been generated using the mcp tool.
- [ ] The 'pom.xml' contains 'flyway-core' and 'spring-boot-starter-actuator'.
- [ ] 'application.properties' contains 'spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate'.
- [ ] 'mvn clean package' completes without errors.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Use the 'springinitializr-mcp' tool to generate the project with dependencies: 'web', 'data-jpa', 'postgresql', 'flyway-migration', 'validation', 'lombok', 'actuator'.
2. Once generated, navigate into its root directory.
3. In 'src/main/resources/application.properties', set 'spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate'.
4. Run 'mvn clean package' to verify the setup.

## Implementation Notes

[2025-07-28 19:56:09] - Starting task: Set Up Initial Spring Boot Project using MCP Tool.

[2025-07-28 19:57:05] - Spring Boot project generated successfully.

[2025-07-29 15:56:18] - Pausing task. The build fails because the database is not running. This task is blocked by task-5, which sets up the PostgreSQL database.
