## Description

Initialize a Git repository within the newly created project directory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A '.git' directory exists in the project root.
- [ ] The 'main' and 'develop' branches exist.
- [ ] The initial commit with all generated files exists.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Navigate into the generated project's root directory ('product-catalog-spring').
2. Run 'git init'.
3. Create a '.gitignore' file if one doesn't exist.
4. Stage all generated files ('git add .').
5. Make the first commit: 'git commit -m \"chore: initial commit of Spring Boot project\"'.
6. Rename the current branch to 'main' if needed.
7. Create the 'develop' branch from 'main'.
