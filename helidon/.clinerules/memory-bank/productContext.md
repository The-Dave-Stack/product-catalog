# Product Context

## Why this project exists
This project exists to provide a modern, high-performance product catalog service. It is specifically designed using Helidon MP to serve as a direct comparison and alternative to Spring Boot-based microservices, demonstrating Helidon's capabilities in a real-world scenario.

## Problems it solves
- Provides a centralized, efficient system for managing product information.
- Offers a clear example of building RESTful APIs with Helidon MP.
- Addresses the need for a cloud-native, container-friendly application.

## How it should work
The service should expose a RESTful API for CRUD operations on products. It should interact with a PostgreSQL database for data persistence. The application should be runnable as a native executable within a Docker container, ensuring fast startup and low resource consumption.

## User experience goals
- **Developers**: Easy to understand, extend, and maintain due to clean architecture and comprehensive documentation.
- **API Consumers**: Intuitive and well-documented API endpoints for seamless integration.
- **Operations**: Lightweight and efficient to deploy and manage in containerized environments.
