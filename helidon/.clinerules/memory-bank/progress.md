# Progress

## What works
- The Git repository is initialized and branches (`main`, `develop`, `feature/task-1-api-design-doc`) are set up correctly.
- The API design document (`./docs/api-design-product-catalog-helidon.md`) has been created and committed.
- The initial Helidon MP project has been set up and builds successfully.

## What's left to build
- All remaining tasks in the backlog, starting with `task-5`.

## Current status
- `task-1` is completed.
- `task-2` is completed.
- The local memory bank structure has been initialized and updated.

## Known issues
- None at this time.

## Evolution of project decisions
- Initial decision to use Helidon MP for product catalog service.
- Decision to use manual SQL scripts for schema management.
- Decision to use GraalVM native executables for containerization.
- Adjusted `helidon init` command usage and `pom.xml` dependency management based on CLI changes.
