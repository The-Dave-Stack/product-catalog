# Active Context

## Current work focus
Currently focused on setting up the foundational elements of the Helidon product catalog service, starting with documentation and initial project setup.

## Recent changes
- Created the `api-design-product-catalog-helidon.md` document.
- Initialized the local memory bank structure.

## Next steps
- Continue with the next task in the backlog, likely related to project scaffolding or database setup.

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensuring all documentation is precise and up-to-date.
- Adhering strictly to Git Flow and Conventional Commits.

## Important patterns and preferences
- Clean Architecture for backend services.
- Test-driven development where applicable.
- Comprehensive documentation for all features.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project structure requires careful attention to the root repository path vs. the Helidon project subdirectory.
