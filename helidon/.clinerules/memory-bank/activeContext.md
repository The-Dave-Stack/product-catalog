# Active Context

## Current work focus
Currently focused on building the core components of the Helidon product catalog service. The business logic layer is now complete with comprehensive ProductService implementation.

## Recent changes
- Completed `task-9`: Implement Business Logic in 'ProductService'.
- Implemented ProductService as @ApplicationScoped CDI bean with complete business logic.
- Added SKU auto-generation in [NNN]-###### format with category-based prefixes.
- Created custom domain exceptions: ProductNotFoundException and DuplicateSkuException.
- Implemented comprehensive validation for product creation, updates, and pagination.
- Added batch operations with transactional integrity and uniqueness validation.
- All compilation and code formatting checks pass successfully.

## Next steps
- Continue with `task-10`: Implement REST Endpoints in 'ProductResource'.

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensuring all documentation is precise and up-to-date.
- Adhering strictly to Git Flow and Conventional Commits.
- Changed `Product` ID type to `String` as per user feedback.
- Implemented `IF NOT EXISTS` in `schema.sql` for idempotent table creation.

## Important patterns and preferences
- Clean Architecture for backend services.
- Test-driven development where applicable.
- Comprehensive documentation for all features.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project structure requires careful attention to the root repository path vs. the Helidon project subdirectory.
- The `helidon init` command options have changed, requiring direct `groupid` and `artifactid` specification, and features are added as separate dependencies in `pom.xml`.
- Successfully integrated Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, and updated Helidon configuration and dependencies for database connectivity.
- Learned to adapt to user-specific schema preferences (String ID) and improve SQL script robustness (`IF NOT EXISTS`).
- Helidon DB Client provides a lightweight alternative to JPA with excellent performance characteristics.
- Proper error handling and logging are crucial for repository layer implementations.
- UUID generation for primary keys works well with PostgreSQL and provides good distribution.
- Business logic layer benefits from CompletableFuture-based reactive patterns for async operations.
- Custom domain exceptions provide clean error handling and better debugging capabilities.
- SKU auto-generation with category prefixes creates meaningful, readable product identifiers.
- CDI @ApplicationScoped beans work seamlessly with Helidon MP for dependency injection.
