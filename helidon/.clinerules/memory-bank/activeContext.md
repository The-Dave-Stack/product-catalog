# Active Context

## Current work focus
Currently focused on setting up the foundational elements of the Helidon product catalog service. The initial project setup for Helidon MP is now complete, and the PostgreSQL database is configured and running via Docker Compose.

## Recent changes
- Created the `api-design-product-catalog-helidon.md` document.
- Initialized the local memory bank structure.
- Completed `task-2`: Set Up Initial Helidon MP Project using a Non-Interactive Command.
- Completed `task-5`: Set Up PostgreSQL with Docker Compose for Helidon.
- Completed `task-6`: Define the 'Product' Data Object (POJO/Record).
- Completed `task-7`: Create Initial DB Schema Script.

## Next steps
- Continue with the next task in the backlog.

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensuring all documentation is precise and up-to-date.
- Adhering strictly to Git Flow and Conventional Commits.
- Changed `Product` ID type to `String` as per user feedback.
- Implemented `IF NOT EXISTS` in `schema.sql` for idempotent table creation.

## Important patterns and preferences
- Clean Architecture for backend services.
- Test-driven development where applicable.
- Comprehensive documentation for all features.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project structure requires careful attention to the root repository path vs. the Helidon project subdirectory.
- The `helidon init` command options have changed, requiring direct `groupid` and `artifactid` specification, and features are added as separate dependencies in `pom.xml`.
- Successfully integrated Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, and updated Helidon configuration and dependencies for database connectivity.
- Learned to adapt to user-specific schema preferences (String ID) and improve SQL script robustness (`IF NOT EXISTS`).
