# Active Context

## Current work focus
Currently focused on building the core components of the Helidon product catalog service. The repository layer is now complete with full CRUD operations using Helidon DB Client.

## Recent changes
- Completed `task-8`: Implement the 'ProductRepository' using Helidon DB Client.
- Implemented ProductRepository interface and ProductRepositoryImpl with comprehensive CRUD operations.
- Added DatabaseConfig for Helidon DB Client configuration.
- Removed unnecessary quickstart template files to clean up the project structure.
- All tests pass and the build is successful.

## Next steps
- Continue with `task-9`: Implement Business Logic in 'ProductService'.

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensuring all documentation is precise and up-to-date.
- Adhering strictly to Git Flow and Conventional Commits.
- Changed `Product` ID type to `String` as per user feedback.
- Implemented `IF NOT EXISTS` in `schema.sql` for idempotent table creation.

## Important patterns and preferences
- Clean Architecture for backend services.
- Test-driven development where applicable.
- Comprehensive documentation for all features.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project structure requires careful attention to the root repository path vs. the Helidon project subdirectory.
- The `helidon init` command options have changed, requiring direct `groupid` and `artifactid` specification, and features are added as separate dependencies in `pom.xml`.
- Successfully integrated Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, and updated Helidon configuration and dependencies for database connectivity.
- Learned to adapt to user-specific schema preferences (String ID) and improve SQL script robustness (`IF NOT EXISTS`).
- Helidon DB Client provides a lightweight alternative to JPA with excellent performance characteristics.
- Proper error handling and logging are crucial for repository layer implementations.
- UUID generation for primary keys works well with PostgreSQL and provides good distribution.
