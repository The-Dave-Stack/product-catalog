# Active Context

## Current work focus
The Helidon product catalog service now has a complete REST layer implementation. All MVP endpoints are functional with comprehensive request/response DTOs, validation, and exception handling.

## Recent changes
- Completed `task-10`: Implement REST Endpoints in 'ProductResource'.
- Created comprehensive DTO package with ProductResponse, CreateProductRequest, BatchCreateProductRequest, and ProductListResponse.
- Implemented ProductResource with all MVP endpoints using JAX-RS annotations and async CompletionStage patterns.
- Added complete exception handling infrastructure with 6 dedicated exception mappers for structured error responses.
- Integrated Jakarta Bean Validation with custom validation messages throughout the request DTOs.
- Added pagination support, category filtering, and export functionality.
- All compilation and code formatting checks pass successfully.

## Next steps
- Consider `task-11`: Unit and Integration Testing implementation.
- Alternative: Continue with additional endpoint implementations (task-15, task-16).

## Active decisions and considerations
- Ensuring all documentation is precise and up-to-date.
- Adhering strictly to Git Flow and Conventional Commits.
- Changed `Product` ID type to `String` as per user feedback.
- Implemented `IF NOT EXISTS` in `schema.sql` for idempotent table creation.

## Important patterns and preferences
- Clean Architecture for backend services.
- Test-driven development where applicable.
- Comprehensive documentation for all features.

## Learnings and project insights
- The project structure requires careful attention to the root repository path vs. the Helidon project subdirectory.
- The `helidon init` command options have changed, requiring direct `groupid` and `artifactid` specification, and features are added as separate dependencies in `pom.xml`.
- Successfully integrated Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, and updated Helidon configuration and dependencies for database connectivity.
- Learned to adapt to user-specific schema preferences (String ID) and improve SQL script robustness (`IF NOT EXISTS`).
- Helidon DB Client provides a lightweight alternative to JPA with excellent performance characteristics.
- Proper error handling and logging are crucial for repository layer implementations.
- UUID generation for primary keys works well with PostgreSQL and provides good distribution.
- Business logic layer benefits from CompletableFuture-based reactive patterns for async operations.
- Custom domain exceptions provide clean error handling and better debugging capabilities.
- SKU auto-generation with category prefixes creates meaningful, readable product identifiers.
- CDI @ApplicationScoped beans work seamlessly with Helidon MP for dependency injection.
- JAX-RS with async CompletionStage provides excellent non-blocking REST endpoint performance.
- Jakarta Bean Validation integrates seamlessly with JAX-RS for automatic request validation.
- Exception mappers provide clean, structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes.
- DTO pattern separation keeps request/response models clean and provides validation boundaries.
- Pagination with metadata responses provides scalable list operations.
