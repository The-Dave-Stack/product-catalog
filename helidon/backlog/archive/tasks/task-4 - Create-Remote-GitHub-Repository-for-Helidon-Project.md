## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "A remote repository named 'product-catalog-helidon' exists on GitHub.
- [ ] The local repository is linked to the remote 'origin'.
- [ ] Both 'main' and 'develop' branches are pushed to the remote.
- [ ] Human review and approval."

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow\nYou are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:\n1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.\n2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.\n3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').\n4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.\n5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.\n6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.\n7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.\n\nUniversal Mandates:\n- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.\n- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n1. Attempt to create a new public GitHub repository named 'product-catalog-helidon' using the 'github-mcp' or 'gh' CLI.\n2. If both methods fail: change the task status to 'Blocked', add a note, reassign to 'David', and stop.\n3. If successful, push 'main' and 'develop' branches to the remote.
