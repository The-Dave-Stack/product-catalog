## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "The Helidon MP project has been generated using the non-interactive 'helidon init' command.
- [ ] The 'pom.xml' contains 'helidon-mp-db-client' and 'helidon-mp-health'.
- [ ] 'mvn clean package' completes without errors.
- [ ] Human review and approval."

## Implementation Plan

⭐ Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Ensure the Helidon CLI is installed and up-to-date.
2. Execute the single, non-interactive command to generate the project skeleton: 'helidon init --flavor mp --group com.thedavestack --artifact product-catalog-helidon --name product-catalog-helidon --features db-client,health'.
3. Once generated, navigate into its root directory.
4. Run 'mvn clean package' to verify the setup.
