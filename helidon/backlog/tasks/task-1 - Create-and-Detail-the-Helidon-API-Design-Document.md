## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The Markdown document 'api-design-product-catalog-helidon.md' is created.
- [x] The document contains all four specified sections.
- [x] The content is exactly as defined in the plan.
- [x] Human review and approval of the final document.
## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Create a new Markdown file at './docs/api-design-product-catalog-helidon.md'.
2. Write the following complete and exact markdown content into the file:

# Product Catalog Service Design (Helidon)

## 1. Purpose

To create a robust and modern RESTful service for product catalog management using the Helidon MP framework, for direct comparison with its Spring Boot counterpart.

## 2. Key Decisions

- **Framework**: Helidon MP 4.x (latest stable version), using Jakarta EE & MicroProfile standards.
- **Database Access**: Helidon DB Client will be used for database interactions, implying manual, programmatic SQL query construction.
- **Schema Management**: A manual SQL script ('schema.sql') will be used to initialize the database schema, executed by the PostgreSQL container on startup.
- **Project Scaffolding**: The Helidon CLI ('helidon init') will be used to generate the initial project structure.
- **Data Model**: The 'Product' class will be a simple Java Record, without persistence annotations.
- **Health Checks**: The application will expose a '/health' endpoint using Helidon Health.
- **Containerization**: The application will be packaged as a GraalVM native executable inside a minimal Docker container.
- **SKU Logic**: SKUs will be auto-generated ('[NNN]-######') if not provided and validated against a specific format if they are.
- **Atomicity**: Bulk creation operations will be transactional.
- **E2E Testing**: A dedicated Maven module ('e2e-tests') will be used with Testcontainers and RestAssured to test the full 'docker-compose' stack.

| :---------- | :------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| id          | String         | Primary Key, UUID            | Unique identifier for the product.          |
| sku         | String         | Not Null, Unique             | Stock Keeping Unit. Auto-generated if null. |
| name        | String         | Not Null                     | Product's name.                             |
| description | String         |                              | Detailed product description.               |
| price       | BigDecimal     | Not Null                     | Price of the product.                       |
| category    | String         |                              | Simple text-based product category.         |
| createdAt   | Instant        |                              | Timestamp of creation (auto-managed).     |
| updatedAt   | Instant        |                              | Timestamp of last update (auto-managed).  |

## 4. API Endpoints
