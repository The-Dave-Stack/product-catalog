## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "Unit tests for 'ProductService' are implemented.
- [ ] Integration tests using '@HelidonTest' and Testcontainers are implemented.
- [ ] 'mvn clean package' runs all tests successfully.
- [ ] Human review and approval."

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow\nYou are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:\n1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.\n2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.\n3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').\n4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.\n5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.\n6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.\n7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.\n\nUniversal Mandates:\n- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.\n- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n1. Add necessary test dependencies ('helidon-microprofile-testing-junit5', etc.).\n2. Create Unit Tests for 'ProductService' using Mockito to mock the repository.\n3. Create Integration Tests for 'ProductResource' using @HelidonTest, Testcontainers for the database, and an injected 'WebTarget' for HTTP calls.
