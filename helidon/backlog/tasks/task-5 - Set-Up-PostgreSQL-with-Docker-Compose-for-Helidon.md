## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "'docker-compose.yml' exists and is correct.
- [ ] 'microprofile-config.properties' contains the correct DB connection properties.
- [ ] 'docker-compose up -d' starts the container successfully.
- [ ] The Helidon application can connect to the database.
- [ ] Human review and approval."

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow\nYou are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:\n1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.\n2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.\n3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').\n4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.\n5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.\n6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.\n7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.\n\nUniversal Mandates:\n- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.\n- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n1. Create a 'docker-compose.yml' file with a 'postgres-db' service using the 'postgres:17.5-alpine' image.\n2. Map port 5432:5432 and configure environment variables.\n3. Define a named volume for persistence.\n4. In 'src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties', add the DB Client connection properties ('db.connection.url', etc.).

## Implementation Notes

2025-08-06 12:27:57 - Completed setup of PostgreSQL with Docker Compose.

Approach taken:
- Created  to define the  service using  image, configured environment variables for database credentials, mapped port 5432, and set up a named volume for persistence.
- Updated  with , , and .
- Added  dependency to .

Features implemented or modified:
- Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL.
- Helidon MicroProfile configuration for database connection.
- Maven dependencies for PostgreSQL driver.

Technical decisions and trade-offs:
- Used  for a lightweight image.
- Used named volumes for data persistence.

Modified or added files:
