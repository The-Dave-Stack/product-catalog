## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] "'ProductRepository.java' is a correct @ApplicationScoped CDI bean.
- [ ] The implementation follows current best practices from Helidon documentation.
- [ ] All CRUD methods are implemented with manual SQL.
- [ ] Batch operations are transactional.
- [ ] Human review and approval."

## Implementation Plan

1. Create DbClient configuration producer for database connectivity
2. Design ProductRepository interface following Clean Architecture
3. Implement ProductRepositoryImpl with all CRUD operations
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Ensure transactional batch operations
6. Apply code formatting and quality standards
7. Create documentation and commit changes

## Implementation Notes

**Implementation Completed - 2025-08-06 15:20:22**

**Approach Taken:**
- Implemented ProductRepository interface with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Used Helidon DB Client for database interactions with proper error handling
- Created DatabaseConfig class for centralized database configuration
- Followed clean architecture patterns with proper separation of concerns

**Features Implemented:**
- ProductRepository interface defining all required operations
- ProductRepositoryImpl with full implementation including:
  - Create operations (single and batch) with UUID generation
  - Find operations (by ID, SKU, category) with pagination support
  - Update and delete operations
  - Count and existence check operations
  - Proper error handling and logging throughout
- DatabaseConfig for Helidon DB Client setup

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used Helidon DB Client instead of JPA for lightweight database access
- Implemented UUID generation for product IDs using Java's UUID.randomUUID()
- Added comprehensive error handling with proper exception propagation
- Used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implemented pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET for scalability

**Modified/Added Files:**
-  (new)
