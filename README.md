# Product Catalog Spring Boot API

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive, enterprise-grade RESTful API for product catalog management using Spring Boot. It serves as a practical example of a modern Java application, demonstrating full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products, including efficient batch creation. The API is designed for robustness, with transactional operations, proper error handling, and comprehensive testing.

## Technologies Used
*   **Language**: Java 21
*   **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.5.4
*   **Build Tool**: Maven
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Schema Migration**: Flyway
*   **Containerization**: Docker
*   **Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers, RestAssured
*   **Code Quality**: Spotless (Google Java Format)
*   **Lombok**: Boilerplate reduction

## Key Features
*   **RESTful API**: Full CRUD operations for products.
*   **Data Persistence**: JPA with Spring Data for seamless database interaction.
*   **Data Validation**: Robust input validation using Spring Boot Validation.
*   **Health Checks**: Actuator endpoints for application monitoring.
*   **Database Migrations**: Managed by Flyway for version-controlled schema evolution.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Unit tests for isolated business logic.
    *   Integration tests for full application flow.
    *   End-to-End (E2E) tests using Testcontainers and RestAssured for API validation against a real PostgreSQL instance.
*   **Containerization**: Docker support for easy deployment and consistent environments.
*   **Code Formatting**: Automated code formatting with Spotless to maintain consistent code style.

## Requirements
*   **Docker**: Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is installed and running.
*   **Java 21**: Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 is installed and configured.
*   **Maven**: Ensure Apache Maven is installed and configured.

## How to Run

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Development)

To run the entire Product Catalog API stack (Spring Boot application and PostgreSQL database) using Docker Compose, navigate to this project's root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This command will:
1.  Build the `product-catalog-spring` Docker image (if not already built or if changes are detected).
2.  Start the `postgres-db` service.
3.  Start the `product-catalog-spring` service, waiting for the database to be healthy.

The Spring Boot application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

To stop and remove the Docker Compose services:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Using Maven (Local Development)

Ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed. Navigate to this project's root directory.

#### Build the Project
To compile the project and package it into an executable JAR:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

#### Run Unit Tests
To run only the unit tests:
```bash
mvn test
```

#### Run Integration Tests
To run the integration tests (which require a running PostgreSQL database, typically managed by Testcontainers during the test phase):
```bash
mvn verify -Pintegration-tests
```

#### Run E2E Tests
To run the end-to-end tests (which also require a running PostgreSQL database via Testcontainers):
```bash
mvn verify -Pe2e-tests
```

#### Run the Application Locally
To run the Spring Boot application directly from Maven (ensure your PostgreSQL database is running, e.g., via `docker compose up` in a separate terminal):
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
