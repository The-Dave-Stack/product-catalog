## Description

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure for security authentication and user management features including unit integration and end-to-end tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all service classes
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication flows
- [ ] End-to-end tests for MCP tools and resources
- [ ] Security penetration testing scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing for authentication
- [ ] Repository tests with test data
- [ ] Controller tests with security contexts
- [ ] API key validation testing
- [ ] Role-based access control testing
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup
