## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The Markdown document 'api-design-product-catalog.md' is created in the ./backlog/docs directory.
- [ ] The document contains all four specified sections (Purpose, Key Decisions, Data Model, API Endpoints).
- [ ] The content accurately and completely reflects all the details defined in the plan.
- [ ] Human review and approval of the final document.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Create a new Markdown file at './docs/api-design-product-catalog.md'.
2. Populate the file with the following sections and content.
3. **Section 1: Purpose**
   - Add a brief description: "To create a robust and modern RESTful service for product catalog management, serving as a portfolio piece and a baseline for framework comparisons."
4. **Section 2: Key Decisions**
   - Document the following decisions:
     - **Technology Stack**: Java 21 (LTS), Spring Boot 3.x, Maven.
     - **Database**: PostgreSQL (image 'postgres:17.5-alpine'), managed via Docker Compose.
     - **Schema Management**: Flyway will be used. Hibernate's 'ddl-auto' will be set to 'validate'.
     - **Entity IDs**: Primary keys will be UUIDs.
     - **SKU Logic**: Auto-generated ('[NNN]-######') if not provided; validated against a format if provided.
     - **Atomicity**: Bulk creation will be transactional.
     - **Health Checks**: A '/actuator/health' endpoint will be exposed.
     - **E2E Testing**: A dedicated Maven module will test the full 'docker-compose' stack with Testcontainers.
5. **Section 3: Data Model**
   - Add the following Markdown table defining the 'Product' entity:
| Field       | Data Type      | Constraints                  | Description                                 |
| :---------- | :------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| id          | String         | Primary Key, UUID            | Unique identifier for the product.          |
| sku         | String         | Not Null, Unique             | Stock Keeping Unit. Auto-generated if null. |
| name        | String         | Not Null                     | Product's name.                             |
| description | String         |                              | Detailed product description.               |
| price       | BigDecimal     | Not Null                     | Price of the product.                       |
| category    | String         |                              | Simple text-based product category.         |
| createdAt   | Instant        |                              | Timestamp of creation (auto-managed).     |
| updatedAt   | Instant        |                              | Timestamp of last update (auto-managed).  |
6. **Section 4: API Endpoints**
   - Add the following Markdown table summarizing the API contract:
| Method | Path                               | Description                           |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| POST   | /api/v1/products                   | Creates a single new product.         |
| POST   | /api/v1/products/batch-create      | Creates multiple products atomically. |
| GET    | /api/v1/products/{id}              | Retrieves a single product by its ID. |
| GET    | /api/v1/products                   | Retrieves a paginated list of products. |
| GET    | /api/v1/products/export?format=json| Exports all products to a JSON file.  |
| PUT    | /api/v1/products/{id}              | Updates an existing product.          |
| DELETE | /api/v1/products/{id}              | Deletes a product.                    |

## Implementation Notes

Created the API design document at backlog/docs/doc-1 - API-Design---Product-Catalog.md with all the specified sections and content.
