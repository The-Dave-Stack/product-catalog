## Description

Create a comprehensive test suite for all layers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for 'ProductService' are implemented.
- [ ] @DataJpaTest tests for 'ProductRepository' are implemented.
- [ ] Integration tests for 'ProductController' with Testcontainers are implemented.
- [ ] 'mvn clean package' runs all tests successfully.
- [ ] Human review and approval.

## Implementation Plan

‚≠ê Golden Rule: The Human-Developer Workflow
You are an expert software developer. For this task, you MUST follow this exact lifecycle:
1. Start Task: Announce you are starting. Change the task status to 'In Progress'. Start the timer using the 'time-mcp' tool.
2. Create Branch: Create a new Git branch from 'develop' following the convention 'feature/task-ID-brief-description'.
3. Execute & Journal: Execute the Implementation Plan below. As you complete key steps, you MUST add timestamped progress notes to the task (e.g., '[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Note content.').
4. Stop & Log Time: When the work is done, stop the timer. Add a final timestamped note with the total time spent.
5. Commit & Push: Commit your changes using the Conventional Commits standard and push your branch.
6. Prepare PR: Generate the title and body for a Pull Request.
7. Finish Task: Change the task status to 'Done'.

Universal Mandates:
- You MUST strictly adhere to all rules in 'global.general.rules.pdf' and 'global.backend.rules.pdf'.
- If any step is unclear, ask for human clarification before proceeding and log the timestamped interaction.

Implementation Plan:
1. Add 'Testcontainers' dependency to pom.xml, if not exists.
2. Check the Unit Tests for 'ProductService' using Mockito and add more if needed.
3. Check the Repository Tests for 'ProductRepository' using @DataJpaTest and add more if needed.
4. Create Integration Tests for 'ProductController' using @SpringBootTest, Testcontainers, and MockMvc.

## Implementation Notes

[2025-08-01 10:05:18] - Verified project dependencies in pom.xml. The required Testcontainers dependencies are present and their versions are managed by the Spring Boot parent POM. No changes are necessary.

[2025-08-01 10:06:54] - Added a new unit test to ProductServiceTest to cover the edge case of calling createMultipleProducts with an empty list.

[2025-08-01 10:07:43] - Reviewed ProductRepositoryTest. The existing tests for custom query methods are comprehensive. No additional tests are needed for the data access layer.

[2025-08-01 10:10:12] - Added integration tests for the GET /api/v1/products/{id} endpoint in ProductControllerIT, covering both success and not-found scenarios.

[2025-08-01 10:12:08] - Final verification complete.
