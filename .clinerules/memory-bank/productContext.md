# Product Context: Why This API Exists

## The Problem
The primary goal of this project is to create a high-quality, well-documented, and robust RESTful API for managing a product catalog. This serves as a practical, real-world example of a modern Spring Boot application, suitable for a portfolio or as a baseline for comparing different backend frameworks. It addresses the need for a clear, standardized, and easily maintainable service for product data.

## How It Should Work
The API should provide a clean, intuitive interface for all standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. It must be efficient, especially for bulk operations, and resilient, with proper error handling and data validation. The entire system, including the database, should be easily reproducible and runnable via Docker, making setup and testing straightforward.

## User Experience Goals
- **For Developers (API Consumers)**: The API should be easy to understand and use, with clear endpoint definitions, predictable behavior, and helpful error messages.
- **For Operators (DevOps)**: The service should be easy to deploy, monitor, and maintain, thanks to containerization with Docker and exposed health check endpoints.
