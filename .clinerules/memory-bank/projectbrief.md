## Core Mission
To develop a comprehensive, enterprise-grade RESTful API for product catalog management using Spring Boot.

## Key Objectives
1.  **Functionality**: Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products, including efficient batch creation.
2.  **Robustness**: Ensure data integrity and service reliability through transactional operations, proper error handling, and comprehensive testing.
3.  **Modern Stack**: Utilize a modern Java stack (Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x) and industry-standard tools (Maven, PostgreSQL, Docker, Flyway).
4.  **Automation**: Automate database schema management, testing, and environment setup.
5.  **Observability**: Expose health check endpoints for monitoring.
6.  **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for the API and project setup.
