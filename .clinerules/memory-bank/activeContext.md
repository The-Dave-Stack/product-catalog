# Active Context: Current Focus and Next Steps

## Current Work Focus
The project has successfully integrated Swagger for API documentation and now includes full CRUD functionality for products. The focus is now on finalizing project documentation and preparing for deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Completed `task-15` (fully)**: Successfully integrated Swagger for API documentation.
- **Completed `task-14` (fully)**: Successfully integrated E2E tests into the main project structure, eliminating the separate `e2e-tests` module.
- **E2E Test Integration**: Moved E2E tests from separate module to `src/test/java/com/thedavestack/productcatalog/e2e/` within the main project.
- **Testcontainers Implementation**: Configured E2E tests to use only PostgreSQL Testcontainer (not full Docker Compose stack) for better isolation and performance.
- **RestAssured Integration**: Added RestAssured dependency to main `pom.xml` for comprehensive API testing.
- **Debug Logging**: Implemented comprehensive debug logging throughout E2E tests for full traceability.
- **Test Coverage**: Created 6 comprehensive E2E test scenarios covering all CRUD operations, error handling, and business logic validation.
- **GitHub Workflows**: Moved GitHub Actions workflows to repository root for multi-framework support.
- **Implemented Product Update Endpoint**: Added `PUT /api/v1/products/{id}` endpoint and corresponding E2E tests (`task-16`).
- **Implemented Product Delete Endpoint**: Added `DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}` endpoint and corresponding E2E tests (`task-17`).

## Next Steps
1. **Project Finalization**: Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and the project is ready for deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Completed `task-13` (fully)**: Updated Final Project Documentation (README.md) to reflect the current state and setup instructions.
- **GitHub Actions Update**: Renamed and updated GitHub Actions workflows (`pr-validation.yml`, `develop-cd.yml`, `main-cd.yml`) to align with the new project structure (Spring project moved to root).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project follows Git Flow branching model with all work done on feature branches off of `develop`.
- All database schema changes are managed via Flyway migrations with no manual database changes permitted.
- E2E tests run against Testcontainers-managed PostgreSQL instance for consistency with production environment.
- E2E tests are now integrated into the main project structure for simplified maintenance and execution.
- GitHub workflows are positioned at repository root to support future multi-framework implementations.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Integrating E2E tests directly into the main project structure provides better maintainability than separate modules.
- Using only PostgreSQL Testcontainer (instead of full Docker Compose) for E2E tests provides better isolation and faster test execution.
- RestAssured provides excellent API testing capabilities with clear, readable test syntax.
- Debug logging in tests is crucial for troubleshooting and understanding test execution flow.
- Repository-level GitHub workflows enable better CI/CD management for multi-framework projects.
- The importance of keeping documentation (especially `progress.md` and `activeContext.md`) in sync with actual code changes to avoid contradictions and ensure accurate project status.
